Building
--------

Move these files into the 'source' directory of the SDK; i.e. they should
be located in SaleaeAnalyzerSdk-1.1.9/source for the unpacked 1.1.9 SDK
in place of any existing files. Typical process is

	unzip  SaleaeAnalyzerSdk-X.Y.zip
	cd SaleaeAnalyzerSdk-X.Y
	mv source source.examples
	git clone git://github.com/dirkx/Quadrature-Saleae-Analyser.git source
	python build_analyzer.py 

And then add the release/debug path to your Logic.app as per the SDK instructions.
